readme_content = """# Helmet Detection and Number Plate Recognition using YOLOv5 and FastAPI ðŸš€  

## Introduction  
This project detects **helmet violations** by identifying two-wheelers where the driver is not wearing a helmet.   

## Technologies Used  
- **Object Detection**: YOLOv5  
- **Backend API**: FastAPI  
- **Dataset**: Custom-labeled images for helmet detection  
- **Deep Learning Framework**: PyTorch  
- **Deployment**: Google Colab (for training), FastAPI (for API integration)  

## Features  
âœ… **Helmet Detection** â€“ Identifies whether a person on a bike is wearing a helmet  
âœ… **Real-time Processing** â€“ Optimized for real-time inference  
âœ… **Scalability** â€“ Can be extended for other traffic rule violations
