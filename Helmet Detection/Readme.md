Helmet Detection and Number Plate Recognition using YOLOv5 and FastAPI ðŸš€

This project detects helmet violations by identifying two-wheelers where the driver is not wearing a helmet. 

Technologies Used: 

Object Detection: YOLOv5
Backend API: FastAPI
Dataset: Custom-labeled images for helmet detection
Deep Learning Framework: PyTorch
Deployment: Google Colab (for training), FastAPI (for API integration)

Features
âœ… Helmet Detection â€“ Identifies whether a person on a bike is wearing a helmet
âœ… Real-time Processing â€“ Optimized for real-time inference
âœ… Scalability â€“ Can be extended for other traffic rule violations
